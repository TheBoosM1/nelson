This user guide covers the information that a user should make themselves familiar with to both get started with Nelson, and also get the most out of the system. Certain parts of Nelson have been covered in more detail than would be typical for an entry-level user guide, but this is to make sure users are fully aware of the choices they are making when building out their deployment specification.
